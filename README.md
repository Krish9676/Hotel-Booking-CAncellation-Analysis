# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Analysis
 This project report focuses on understanding the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations and provides insights to make hotel reservation cancellations better. The analysis explores factors such as pricing, waiting lists, and the influence of offline travel agents. The findings indicate that higher prices and longer waiting lists tend to result in more cancellations. Additionally, the report highlights the impact of reservation cancellations on hotel earnings and identifies the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels. The report suggests strategies to mitigate cancellations, including pricing optimization, discounts during weekends and holidays, targeted marketing campaigns, and improvements in service quality. By implementing these recommendations, hotels can reduce cancellation rates and enhance revenue.
